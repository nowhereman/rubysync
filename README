ABOUT:

RubySync is a tool for synchronizing part or all of your directory, database or application data with anything else. It's event driven so it will happily sit there monitoring changes and passing them on. Alternatively, you can run it in one-shot mode and simply sync A with B.

You can configure RubySync to perform transformations on the data as it syncs. RubySync is designed both as a handy utility to pack into your directory management toolkit or as a fully-fledged provisioning system for your organisation.

RubySync is licenced under the GPL version 2.

STATUS:

2007-02-15 RubySync is in active development but is sadly not available to use yet. I hope to get it to an alpha stage with it soon.

CONTRIBUTING:

I hope you find RubySync useful. If you feel you can contribute in any way I would be very pleased to hear from you. Areas where contributions of time would be useful include:

	- Testing. Please report any bugs or ideas to improvements to the mailing list.
	
	- Artwork and Web Page design.

Contact me on the project's forums at http://rubysync.rubyforge.org if you can help.
