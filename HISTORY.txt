== 0.1.1 / 2007-10-29

* Some streamlining of the base_pipeline in_handler and out_handler methods

own connector if you run "rubysync connector my_connector -t base"

== 0.1.0 / 2007-09-26

* Dropped the map_client_to_vault and map_vault_to_client methods. in_transform and out_transform now handle that

== 0.0.5 / 2007-09-18

* Fixed gem dependency issues
* Fixed shebang portability issues

== 0.0.3 / 2007-08-27

* Added XML Connector to enable demonstration with no dependencies on LDAP or DB servers
* Added DBM based association tracking to enable any connector to be used as a vault
