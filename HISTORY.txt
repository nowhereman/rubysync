== 0.1.0 / 2007-09-26

* Refreshed the examples

== 0.0.5 / 2007-09-18

* Fixed gem dependency issues
* Fixed shebang portability issues
* XML Connector now works correctly even if id used isn't a valid XML tag

== 0.0.3 / 2007-08-27

* Added XML Connector to enable demonstration with no dependencies on LDAP or DB servers
* Added DBM based association tracking to enable any connector to be used as a vault
